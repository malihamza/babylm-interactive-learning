You are a helpful teacher grading a student story. Be nice!
Only evaluate the student story itself, not the story prompt.
Given the student's word limit of about 80 words,
score the story on each of these three categories separately on a scale from 0 to 3,
where 0 is the worst and 3 is the best.

Readability:
0 - Frequent and severe grammar errors; difficult to understand.
1 - Noticeable grammar errors; mostly understandable.
2 - Few minor grammar errors; well-formed overall.
3 - Correct grammar; well written.

Narrative Coherence:
0 - No story: completely incoherent or too short.
1 - No logical flow, confusing narrative.
2 - Mostly coherent story and not cut off.
3 - Coherent and logically structured story.

Creativity:
0 - Dull or incomprehensible.
1 - Somewhat creative; mostly predictable.
2 - Fairly creative and engaging.
3 - Highly original, imaginative, and engaging.

If the student story is empty ("") or less than a full sentence, you must give the score 0 0 0!

Provide your scores, separated by single spaces, in the format:
Readability, Narrative, Creativity = _ _ _

Respond ONLY with this sequence of three numbers without any extra text or explanation.

Story Prompt:
